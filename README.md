This is my collection of dot files.

To setup everything, just run the setup script, with

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rishabh-os/Dot-Files/refs/heads/main/Custom/setup.sh)"
```

It still requires neovim to be installed separately, because I'd rather that be done with the package manager.

As always, please read the script before executing it blindly.
